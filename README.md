Purpose of the app: We all have a dream life that we imagine for ourselves. 
Sometimes our natural tendencies get in the way of creating our dream goals and 
sometimes we need a little “nuddge” to help us come out of our comfort zone to start 
making that dream life happen.

Studies show that when we record and track our goals, we are more likely to be successful. 
Nuddge Goal Tracker App is here to help you track your progress and step out of your comfort zone.

Nuddge is here to push you to create your dream life one nuddge at a time and become a better you!

How to use: Users are able to create an account and login in securely! After they login the user is able to create their Nuddges. 
Each Nuddge has a category for the user to select from, an option to add a brief description, and a “boost date”. 
A boost date is a date picked by the user for them to receive a little nuddge to complete their goal! Users are able to filter their 
Nuddges by category to organize their goals. They can also filter to see the goals they have completed. Each time you successfully 
complete a goal, you earn Nuddge points! The points show your progress and encourage you to keep going. We are all different! 
Keeping that in mind, we allow our users to choose the point value of each Nuddge goal based off of their personal hierarchy scale.

Features: 
- Secure login
- 6 categories to choose from: Career, Education, Fitness, Hobbies, Mental Health, & Social
- Boost date: date selected to give you an extra “nuddge”
- Dashboard: where you can view all (users) Nuddges for inspiration
- Points box: located in the upper corner where you can see your total points displayed
- Filter: Filter to individual category or to completed to see how far you’ve come
